# Pubg-No-Recoil-for-Logitech-mouse-keyboard
Lua file and c tools

Tere is 3 different program 
one is the lua witch you have to insert to your mice.
there is a function in this code to send win32 debug messages.

the second program is to catch these messages and ibform you while you in the game

and the tird program is for read the recoil patterns. 
In this You have to use Autocad, this program is a COM for autocad
Use:
use debug on visual studio and set autocad to external program 

printscreen your pattern
import to autocad
use polyline to define the patern
poliline origin have to same place as absloute coord system origin
In autocad command line:"NETLOAD"
browse your dll
In autocad command line:"GETPOINTS"
because youre in debug mode you can catch the pattern



i have no time for work further in this projekt (its useful now its good for me), 
but these pattern reading method you got a really correct pattern
